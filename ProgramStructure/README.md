# Introduction to Go Programming
Welcome to the first module of our Go programming series! In this module, we'll cover the basics of the Go programming language and set up your environment for Go development.

## What is Go?
Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrency. Go is used in a variety of applications, from web servers and APIs to cloud services and large distributed systems.

## Setting Up Your Go Environment
Before we dive into writing Go code, you'll need to set up your Go development environment. Follow these steps to get started:

## Download and Install Go:

Visit the official Go downloads page and download the Go installer for your operating system.
Follow the installation instructions for your platform.
Verify Your Installation:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to check your Go version:
```
go version
```
You should see the version of Go that you installed.

## Set Up Your Workspace:

Go code is typically organized in a workspace, which contains Go source files, packages, and binaries.
By default, Go uses the directory go in your home directory ($HOME/go on Unix-like systems, %USERPROFILE%\go on Windows) as the workspace. You can change this location by setting the GOPATH environment variable.
## Writing Your First Go Program
Now that you have your environment set up, let's write a simple Go program:

Create a new file named hello.go in your workspace.

Add the following code to hello.go:
``` Go 
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}

```
